# Jumping-Box
This program has been developed via JavaScript Coding Platform.
If the moving ball touches any of the platforms then it will change to the colour of the platform.
If the moving ball touches the darkblue platform then the ball will stop.
If the moving ball touches the blue platform then a sound will play.(not sure why wasn't playing on my laptop)
